# Largest Smaller BST Key

Given a root of a Binary Search Tree (BST) and a number num, implement an efficient function findLargestSmallerKey that finds the largest key in the tree that is smaller than num. If such a number doesn’t exist, return -1. Assume that all keys in the tree are nonnegative.

Analyze the time and space complexities of your solution.

### Example

For num = 17 and the binary search tree below:

![largest-smaller-bst-key](https://www.pramp.com/img/content/img_02.png)

Your function would return `14` since it’s the largest key in the tree that is still smaller than `17`.

### Constraints

- [time limit] 5000ms
- [input] Node rootNode
- [output] integer
