# Construct a complete binary tree from given array in level order fashion

Given an array of elements, our task is to construct a complete binary tree from this array in level order fashion. That is, elements from left in the array will be filled in the tree level wise starting from level 0.

## Examples:

```
Input  :  arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
Output : Root of the following tree
                  1
                 / \
                2   3
               / \ /
              4  5 6

Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6}
Output: Root of the following tree
                   1
                  / \
                 2   3
                / \ / \
               4  5 6  6
              / \ /
             6  6 6
```
